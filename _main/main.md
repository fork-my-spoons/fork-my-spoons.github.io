## Getting started

### [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/)

>This is a tool for powerful automation of OS X. At its core, Hammerspoon is just a bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine. What gives Hammerspoon its power is a set of extensions that expose specific pieces of system functionality, to the user.
 
### [Spoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/blob/master/SPOONS.md)

> Spoons are intended to be pure-Lua plugins for users to use in their Hammerspoon configs.
  
> As a community, we have created many great configurations for Hammerspoon, but sharing code between them is hard and fragile. Spoons have been created as a way to address these issues. Users should be able to download a Spoon and quickly integrate it into their config without worrying about what it is doing internally.
